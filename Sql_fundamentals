# Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact
with relational databases.

This document introduces the purpose of SQL and how it is used in
data analytics, data engineering, and backend systems.







# What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  
It is used to:
- Store data
- Retrieve data
- Update data
- Delete data

## What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically
and managed by a Database Management System (DBMS).

### Examples of Databases
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server
- Oracle









# DBMS and SQL Server

## DBMS
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that:
- Manages databases
- Handles data storage
- Controls access and security

Examples:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server

## SQL Server
SQL Server is a relational DBMS developed by Microsoft.
It supports T-SQL (Transact-SQL) for querying and managing data.












# Types of Databases

## Relational Databases
- Store data in tables
- Use SQL
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

## Non-Relational Databases
- Store data as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs
- Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra














# Types of SQL Commands

## DDL (Data Definition Language)
- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP
- TRUNCATE

## DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

## DQL (Data Query Language)
- SELECT

## DCL (Data Control Language)
- GRANT
- REVOKE

## TCL (Transaction Control Language)
- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK
- SAVEPOINT












# Why Learn SQL?

SQL is essential for:
- Data Analysts
- Business Analysts
- Data Scientists
- Backend Developers

Benefits:
- Easy to learn
- Used across industries
- Works with large datasets
- Required for analytics and reporting
